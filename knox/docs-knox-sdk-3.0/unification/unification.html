<h1>Unification Impact:</h1>
<br><br>

<h2 style="color:blue;">Abstract</h2>

Today IT admins and EMMs have two solutions for managing and securing work data on enterprise Android devices: Android Enterprise and Samsung Knox Workspace. The two solutions are very similar and are resulting in market confusion. As part of a joint effort Google and Samsung have decided to unify Android Enterprise and Samsung Workspace in Android O. 

Following sections provide a description of the current solutions and details on the future unified solution.

<h2 style="color:blue;">Android Enterprise</h2> 

Android Enterprise is a solution provided by Google to manage enterprise data on Android devices. Android Enterprise has mainly two modes
<br>
1. Work Profile
<br>
2. Work Managed Device
<br><br>
<b>Work Profile</b> is a container that allows IT admins to separate enterprise work data from personal data. EMM agent can become a Profile Owner (PO) and allow IT admins to manage and apply policies for the Work Profile. This configuration is for BYOD scenarios, where the enterprise allows work data on end user’s personal device. 
<br><br>
<b>Work Managed Device</b> mode allows IT admin to manage the entire device. EMM agent can become a Device Owner (DO) and allow IT admins to manage and apply polices for the entire device. This configuration is for Corporate Owned device scenarios, where the enterprise issues the device to end users. 
<br><br>
<b>Note:</b> In the latest Android O release from Google enterprises will be able to create a Work Profile on a Work Managed Device. Thus, supporting use cases where the enterprise can manage the entire device along with separating enterprise and personal data.

<h2 style="color:blue;">Samsung Knox Workspace</h2>

Knox Workspace is a solution provided by Samsung to secure enterprise data on Samsung mobile devices. Workspace can be configured in the following modes.
<br>
1. Corporate Liable (CL)/B2B
<br>
2. Container Only Mode (COM)
<br>
3. BYOD mode
<br><br>
<b>Corporate Liable (CL)/B2B</b> mode allows IT admins to manage the entire device while also providing a container to separate enterprise and personal data via a container. EMM agent becomes the device admin along with the admin of the container thus allowing IT admin to apply polices for both the entire device and container.
<br><br>
<b>Container Only Mode (COM)</b> allows IT admin to lock the user to the container. User is not allowed to access the rest of the device. This configuration is for highly security sensitive organizations that want to protect sensitive data on mobile devices. 
<br><br>
<b>BYOD</b> mode is a container that allows IT admins to separate enterprise work data from personal data. EMM agent can become container admin and allow IT admins to manage and apply policies for the container only. This configuration is for BYOD scenarios, where the enterprise allows work data on end user’s personal device. 
<br>
<h2 style="color:blue;">Unification</h2>

The two solutions, Android Enterprise and Knox Workspace, are very similar. Customers are finding it hard to distinguish between the two and EMMs partners can’t justify supporting both.

As a result, Google and Samsung have worked together to combine Android Enterprise and Samsung Knox Workspace into one solution. 

<h2 style="color:blue;">Unified Solution</h2>
As part of unification customers can leverage Knox features and APIs on Android Enterprise configurations by simply activating a Knox License. IT admins can activate a Knox License on an Android Work Profile and now leverage Knox features on the Work Profile. Similarly, IT admins can activate a Knox License on an Android Work Managed Device and now leverage Knox features on the Work Managed Device. Customers no longer have to choose between Android Enterprise and Knox Workspace.

<h2 style="color:blue;">Existing Knox Workspace Modes</h2>
The unified solution will be available in Android O. Existing Knox Workspace modes of CL, COM and BYOD will also continue to be available and supported in Android O. Eventually once unified solution is adopted and supported by EMM partners, Samsung will look into moving away from the existing CL, COM and BYOD modes.

<h2 style="color:blue;">Impacted Knox APIs</h2>
Unification enables EMM agent to apply both Android and Knox APIs on one solution. Certain Knox APIs provide either exact same or similar functionality as Android APIs. As a result, there are Knox APIs that are impacted due to Unification. These ‘Impacted’ Knox APIs are marked in the SDK and are candidates for future deprecation once the unified solution is adopted and supported by EMM partners.
